## Max sum of digits within a string

Given an array of strings, each made up of a combination of letters and digits, write the functionality to find and return the largest sum of digits within a string.

Considering a variety of different input arrays, state any assumptions or design choices you had to make

Notes:

- Each digit should be considered its own 1-digit number i.e. in the third string below 36 is evaluated as 3 and 6 separately.
- The input arrays can vary in length; however, they will not be larger than 10 strings.
- Strings can vary in length; however, they will not be larger than 12 characters.

### Example:
```python
Input		[ "dh7js4jf", "or2rjvn2w", "h1n36mfl", "a7e6fw" ]

has the sums		11, 4, 10, 13 respectively

so the output is		13
```
